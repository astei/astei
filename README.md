### Hi there 👋

My name is Andrew Steinborn. I'm a computer science student and ☕ enthusiast. Most of my work has been with Minecraft, but I've dabbled in some other stuff too.

✍️ I'm currently working on [Velocity](https://www.velocitypowered.com), [Crafthead](https://crafthead.net) and some other projects.

💬 Outside of development and web design, I love to play video games, talk about history, write some creative fiction, read speculative fiction, science fiction, and non-fiction books (mostly history), and listen to music (I'm a well-listened man!)
