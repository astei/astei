### Hi there, how are you? 👋

My name is Andrew Steinborn. I'm a software engineer and ☕ enthusiast.

😄 Pronouns: _he/him_

✍️ As of November 2021, I am a full-time software engineer at [Ramp](https://ramp.com).

🔭 Some of the projects I'm most notable for include [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) and [Crafthead](https://crafthead.net).

🌱 I'm currently looking to learn Rust and Elixir.

💬 Outside of development and web design, I love to play video games, talk about history, write some creative fiction, read speculative fiction, science fiction, and non-fiction books (mostly history), and listen to music (I'm a well-listened man!)
