### Hi there, how are you? 👋

My name is Andrew Steinborn. I'm a software engineer and ☕ enthusiast who lives in New York City. 

😄 Pronouns: _he/him_

✍️ As of November 2021, I am a full-time senior software engineer at [Ramp](https://ramp.com). I've worked on both payments and card issuing - quite the departure from Minecraft, but you won't believe just how many transferable skills there are :)

🔭 Some of the projects I'm most notable for include [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com), a Minecraft proxy now maintained by the Paper team, and [Crafthead](https://crafthead.net), now maintained by Nodecraft.

💬 Outside of software development, I love to talk about history, write some creative fiction, read speculative fiction (particularly alternate history), science fiction, and non-fiction books (mostly history), and listen to music (I'm a well-listened man!)

⚡ Fun fact for the train nerds: out of all the 16 U.S. rapid transit systems, I've been on 7 of them. Most recently, it was the Washington Metro, but obviously I take the New York City Subway frequently for work.
